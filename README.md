# Pokémon Crystal Final

This is a hack/mod to try and make a definitive version of Pokemon Crystal.
To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
Final saves are not fully compatible with vanilla saves and the other way around. 

# Features
 - Fixes all of the glitches/bugs in the original game, as listed by the pret team.
 - Adds menu sprites/graphics for every pokemon including correct colours.
 - Adds the option to move faster while walking (running) by holding B.
 - Allows the player to register all NPC phone numbers, instead of just 10.
   - Increases likelyhood of trainers that inform of Swarms to call players.
 - Pokemon availability and diversity:
   - Trainer team overhauls, based on HG/SS.
   - Made some pokemon more widely available.
   - Increased the amount of pokemon available in the wild.
 - HM usage in Kanto proper now requires the respective Kanto badges.
 - New and unique music (Day/Night variants, Kanto HGSS songs)

# Status
Used as a base for the upcoming "Pokémon Stories" series of hacks. Pokémon Crystal Final is essentially complete. 

## Planned Features
 - Automatic patch creation in Github Workflow
 - Bike riding faster than running
